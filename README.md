# DevHub
DevHub is a proxy hub, mostly meant to be a fast one stop shop for a high speed proxy and tons of games. All of this was possible because of  [Ultraviolet](https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/Ultraviolet)!

# How does it work?
Using [Ultraviolet](https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/Ultraviolet), you can proxy sites through a [Bare Server](https://github.com/tomphttp/bare-server-node). Most of DevHub is frontend, the only part of backend is the TOMPHTTP Bare Server.
